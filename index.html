                    <h3>1. Pre-Arrival Recommendations</h3>
                    <li>- Before your arrival in Ghana, I am happy to offer recommendations for hotels, transport options, dining, and other services that can make your stay more comfortable. I can suggest well-regarded places based on your preferences, budget, and needs.</li>
                    <li>- However, it is important to note that while I can assist with recommendations, you are responsible for making all the bookings, arrangements, and payments for these services.</li>

                    <li>- Additionally, you should have your hotel booked and ready. My role is to welcome you upon arrival and accompany you to your accommodation or destination. I will not be responsible for any logistics related to transport or lodging, and these costs will be your responsibility.

                    <li>- Should our plans require us to travel to a different location, you will be responsible for covering hotel and accommodation costs. I will accompany you, but all accommodations, transport, and activities must be pre-arranged and paid for by you, including my services.

                    <li>- The duration of our time together is determined based on the booking. If you wish to extend our time together beyond the initially agreed-upon period, please let me know ahead of time, and the appropriate fee will be applied for any additional hours.</li>
                    <li>- Cancellations made less than 24 hours in advance will incur a cancellation fee as outlined in the Terms & Conditions.</li>

                    <li>- Your health and safety, as well as mine, are of utmost importance. If at any point, I feel that our activities might not be in a safe environment, I reserve the right to end the meeting.</li>
                    <li>- Please inform me of any dietary restrictions, allergies, or medical conditions that I should be aware of to avoid any uncomfortable situations during our time together.</li>

                    <h3>8. Respecting Boundaries</h3>
                    <li>- Mutual respect is the cornerstone of our engagement. Any behavior that makes me uncomfortable or violates personal boundaries will result in the immediate termination of our interaction, without a refund. I expect the same level of respect and consideration from you at all times. Likewise, I am committed to maintaining a professional demeanor and ensuring that I do not infringe upon your personal space or comfort. Respect and professionalism are key to a positive and enjoyable experience for both of us. </li>
